    "# Homework 2 Parts 1-3: Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework will have you implementing word2vec using PyTorch and let you familiarize yourself with building more complex neural networks and the larger PyTorch development infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, this homework consists of a few major parts:\n",
    "1. Implement a `Corpus` class that will load the dataset and convert it to a sequence of token ids\n",
    "2. Implement negative sampling to select tokens to be used as negative examples of words in the context\n",
    "3. Create your dataset of positive and negative examples per context and load it into PyTorch's `DataLoader` to use for sampling\n",
    "4. Implement a `Word2Vec` class that is a PyTorch neural network\n",
    "5. Implement a training loop that samples a _batch_ of target words and their respective positive/negative context words\n",
    "6. Implement rare word removal and frequent word subsampling\n",
    "7. Run your model on the full dataset for at least one epoch\n",
    "8. Do the exploratory parts of the homework\n",
    "9. Save vectors and word-indexing data for later use in training a classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "After Step 5, you should be able to run your word2vec implementation on a small dataset and verify that it's learning correctly. Once you can verify everything is working, proceed with steps 6 and beyond. **Please note that this list is a general sketch and the homework PDF has the full list/description of to-dos and all your deliverables.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimated performance times on medium dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We designed this homework to be run on a laptop-grade CPU, so no GPU is required. If your primary computing device is a tablet or similar device, this homework can also be _developed_ on that device but then run on a more powerful machine in the Great Lakes cluster (for free). Such cases are the exception though. Following, we report on the estimated times from our reference implementation on the medium dataset for longer-running or data-intensive pieces of the homework. Your timing may vary based on implementation design; major differences in time (e.g., 10x longer) usually point to a performance bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reading and tokenizing: ~5 seconds\n",
    "* Subsampling and converting to token ids: ~15 seconds\n",
    "* Generating the list of training examples: ~2 minutes (~15 minutes before the random number generator fix)\n",
    "* Training one epoch: ~12 minutes"

    "# Create an efficient random number generator (do this part this later)\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers have to work to generate random numbers. However, the effort for getting those random numbers varies by how many you ask for. In practice, it's _much_ more efficient to generate many random numbers at once, rather than one at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In generating the training data for word2vec, you'll be generating a lot of random numbers. We've added a helpful class that you can use to eventually speed things up. You should use an instance of this `RandomNumberGenerator` class to generate the numbers you need (rather than using `np.random`). This class should work as a quick drop-in in its current implementation. **You should change the implementation of this class _only_ after getting the rest of your code debugged**. Once you get things working, update the code in this class so that it will create large buffers of random numbers and then when asked for a new number, read the next number from the buffer instead of calling `random` or `randint`. Essentially, this class will pre-allocate many random numbers ahead of time and then return them in order to avoid the overhead of generating them one at a time. You could see up to an ~80% performance improvement in your negatve sampling code generation as a result of this!"

You can iterate over the batches and each iteration will return all the items eventually, one batch at a time (a full epoch's worth).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second new part is using `wandb`. As you might have noticed in Homework 1, training neural models can take some time. [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) is a handy web-based view that you can check during training to see how the model is doing. We'll use it here and periodically log a running sum of the loss after a set number of steps. The Homework write up has a plot of what this looks like. We'll be doing something simple here with wandb but it will come in handy later as you train larger models (for longer) and may want to visually check if your model is converging and is [easy to integrate](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/pytorch).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get the code working, to start training, we recommend training on the `reviews-word2vec.med.txt` dataset. This data is small enough you can get through an epoch in a few minutes (or less) while still being large enough you can test whether the model is learning anything by examining common words. Below this cell we've added a few helper functions that you can use to debug and query your model. In particular, the `get_neighbors()` function is a great way to test: if your model has learned anything, the nearest neighbors for common words should seem reasonable (without having to jump through mental hoops). An easy word to test on the `med` data is \"january\" which should return month-related words as being most similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Since we're training biographies, the text itself will be skewed towards words likely to show up biographices--which isn't necessary like \"regular\" text. You may find that your model has few instances of words you think are common, or that the model learns poor or unusual neighbors for these. When querying the neighbors, it can help to think of which words you think are likely to show up in biographies on Wikipedia and use those as probes to see what the model has learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're convinced the model is learning, switch to the `med` data and train your model as specified in the PDF. Once trained, save your model using the `save()` function at the end of the notebook. This function records your data in a common format for word2vec vectors and lets you load the vectors into other libraries that have more advanced functionality. In particular, you can use the [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/tutorials/run_word2vec.html) code in other notebook included to explore the vectors and do simple vector analogies."
