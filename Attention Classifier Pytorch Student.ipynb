    "# Homework 2 Part 4: Attention-based classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This last part of homework 2 will have you _using_ the vectors we learned from your word2vec implementation to do classification. You should complete the initial word2vec part before before starting on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, this last part of the homework consists of a few major steps:\n",
    "1. Load in the data, word vectors, and word-indexing\n",
    "2. Define the attention-based classification network\n",
    "3. Train your model at least one epoch (2+ is recommended though).\n",
    "4. Perform exploratory analyses on attention\n",
    "5. Test the effects of freezing the pre-trained word vectors (see homework PDF for details)\n",
    "\n",
    "After Step 2, you should be able to train your classifier implementation on a small percent of the dataset and verify that it's learning correctly. **Please note that this list is a general sketch and the homework PDF has the full list/description of to-dos and all your deliverables.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimated performance times\n",
    "\n",
    "We designed this homework to be run on a laptop-grade CPU, so no GPU is required. If your primary computing device is a tablet or similar device, this homework can also be _developed_ on that device but then run on a more powerful machine in the Great Lakes cluster (for free). Such cases are the exception though. Following, we report on the estimated times from our reference implementation for longer-running or data-intensive pieces of the homework. Your timing may vary based on implementation design; major differences in time (e.g., 10x longer) usually point to a performance bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reading data, tokenizing, and converting to ids: ~20 seconds\n",
    "* Training one epoch: ~18 minutes\n",
    "* Training one epoch using frozen embeddings: ~3 minutes\n",
    "* Evaluating on dev/test set: ~5 seconds"

    "\n",
    "### How many instances do we need to learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the word2vec vectors capture word meaning, do we need to see a lot of examples to train an effective classifier? Maybe we can get away with fewer (or not?). Try making a plot that shows the performance of training on 1 epoch with varying numbers of training examples. What if we just had 10 examples? 100? 1000? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Make the \"important word\" vectors learn different attentions\n",
    "\n",
    "If your attention vectors are learning to look at similar words, we could try to add some structure to how we learn so these vectors become dissimilar. One idea is to penalize the model according to how similar each head's vector is to the others. You could use cosine similarity or MSE or any weighting function. For example, you could add the cosine similarities of each pair to the `loss` so that the model benefits from learning orthoginal or dissimlar vectors. Would this help? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Add more layers to the network\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second easiest one, but can be fun. What if you add more layers after you aggregate? Does letting the different attention heads' representations interact give better performance? Find out!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change the learning rate dynamically\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a fixed learning rate, but what if we wanted to decrease the learning rate as the model starts to converge? In many cases, this can help the model take smaller but more precise steps towards the best possible parameters. PyTorch supports this with _learning rate schedulers_ that tell pytorch how and when to change the learning rate. See if you can get a better performance using a scheduler!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add support for batch sizes > 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This is non-trivial but will increase training speed _a lot_. The main issue with increasing batch sizes is that our input sequences (the word ids) in a batch will have different lengths. Under the hood, pytorch is turning your code into a series of very fast matrix operations. However, if those matrices suddenly have difference sizes, the math no longer works. As a result developers (like us) have to do a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need to _pad_ the sequences with empty values so that all sequences have the same length. You could do this by  adding an extra word ID that is the \"empty token\" and make sure its values are set to 0 (so it won't interact with anything)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set up a collate function in our DataLoader that automatically pads each batch's data based on the longest length in the batch\n",
    "\n",
    "* At inference time, it's also efficient to mask part of the sequence that's the padded part so we ignore the computations for that part in anything downstream. Depending on how you set it up, you may be able to avoid this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to dig into this, you might see some of the documentation around packed and padded sequences in pytorch. You won't need to use these functions but they can provide more context for what's happening and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add positional information to the word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now our model doesn't know much about which order the words are in. What if we helped the model in this? One way that people have done this is to _add_ some positional embedding to the word embedding, where the positional embedding represents which position in the sequence is in. There are many complicated schemes for this, but one potential idea is to _learn the positional embeddings_. You would keep a separate `Embedding` object for positions with the number of positions up to the length of your longest sequence in the data. Then for the word in the first position, you add `position_embeddings(0)` to it. You can definitely speed that up by passing in a sequence of the positions in the current input and, conveniently, pytorch will let you easily add all the position embeddings to the word embeddings easily (no for loop required).\n",
    "\n",
    "Will it help here? I have no idea but I'm curious.\n",
